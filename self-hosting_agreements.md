# Self-hosting Agreements for Aruna
By self-hosting your own copy of Aruna, you fully agree to the agreements and requirements set in this document. If found breaking these, I will blacklist you from the full version of the bot and take action as needed.

## Main Agreements
When self-hosting.. you agree:
- To not publicly list your self-hosted copy on any websites, or public material.
- To not promote your version as the official bot.
- To not use any official Aruna content (ie. emojis, logos, names).
- To not sell or distribute your self-hosted copy across servers you don't manage/own.
- To not remove any credit to me (Caelin Jai) or any contributors/libraries.
- To not break the MIT Licence the bot has been put under.
- To not claim any single part of the open source code as your own. Self made commands and content is fine.

> Even if your hosting a copy for development, for testing of PR'd features or anything, you still agree fully to the self-hosting agreements.
