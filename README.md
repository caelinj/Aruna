# Aruna
A Discord bot made for everyone, helping your server with lots of features, such as fun, music and information!

### A quick note..
Aruna is in pre-alpha/development, and honestly isn't ready to be used publicly. Things will break, she will pop on and off a lot. If your brave and still want to feel her *limited* power, you can add her by [clicking here (me!!)](https://discord.now.sh/483481409302822912?p0).

Please report any bugs in the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/tNymTcj).

## Things Aruna has:
- ~~Music!~~ Currently disabled, working on moving it to a better system (music is not on the GitHub repository, fyi)
- Loads of fun commands to keep you and your friends entertained for hours!
- Image and text manipulation, make yourself into Batman and slap your friend, put yourself in a trashcan, or make all your text superscript!
- Moderation, auto-mod and moderation logs to keep your precious server clean and happy.
- Informative commands as well as utilities, check server or user information, get a subreddit post, even search the web!

## I want to contribute!
Woah~! There's a few ways you can contribute to Aruna development:

### General code improvements, and major additions/fixes
All code **must** follow the [contribution guide]() (<-- click there to find it) to be accepted. Simple fixes like changing formatting or using a different method will not be accepted unless it improves the bot somehow (ie. making it quicker or tidying up code). Major changes must be made stable and follow the general flow/look of the bot, as an example, adding a random command that doesn't fit into an existing category or topic won't be accepted.

### Translations to different locales
Translations are greatly appreciated - if you can. Simply going onto Google Translate and pasting stuff in won't be accepted, I can do that myself, but it isn't accurate, can bug probably, and honestly just isn't cool, it's cheating. I'm looking for actual native speaking users that can translate the bot alltogether easily. If you want to, add me on Discord at `caelin#3152`, or [join the support server](https://discord.gg/tNymTcj), and we can have a chat.

### I can't do any of that
Aww.. that's okay. You can still support and contribute to Asuna! General typo fixes and little improvements like whitespace fixes are appreciated, as well as a *star on the repo* or an [*upvote*]() to help Aruna grow. And - domations are welcome too~!!
